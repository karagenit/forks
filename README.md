# Github Repository Forks

Find Most Updated Forks of a Github Repository.

Inspired by [this project](http://forked.yannick.io/). However, I wanted to redo it so that it was able to deliver better results via the GraphQL v4 API. 

## Setup & Install

Requires `bootstrap v3.3.7` extracted in the `bootstrap/` directory. Requires files `client_id.token` and `client_secret.token` located in the root project directory - you are given these keys when you register a Github OAuth app.
